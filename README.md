## Project Info

We created this randomly generating art program so that it is easier to create numerous amout of art piece by just drawing few components. I learned a lot about python and how images work. We were stuck on a problem for 3 hours, but it turns out the we were careless about the name of the imported libraries! This challenge led us to learn more about python!
